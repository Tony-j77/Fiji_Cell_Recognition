# Fiji_Cell_Recognition

This was my summer 2021 project at the University of Calgary where a solution was needed to measure the expression of the Celf2 gene outside of the nucleus of Mus musculus during E14, E7, P0, P14 and P21 stages of development. 

This neural network interacts with the Fiji Macro API to significantly reduce the image processing time from weeks to hours. The neural network also eliminates inaccuracies and discrepancies as a result of human error.
